This project uses the built-in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality built into Android devices
to create Phantom Bluetooth Device Advertisements, similar to what is known, for instance, in the case of the Flipper Zero.
While other apps are available that provide similar functionality, the objective of this app is to enhance convenience and user-friendliness in the process.

## Requirements

<details >
<summary>Details</summary>
<br>
- Android 8.0 (API level 26) or later <br>
 <br>
Tip: If you don't know your API level visit <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platforms">SDK Platform release notes</a>. You also can view your Android version in the Info tab in settings.
 <br>
   <br>
- You can not run the app on IOS or PC (even with emulators/VM's)

</details>


## Functionality

<details >
<summary>Sending BLE advertisements (Pop-Ups)</summary>
<br>
This app can send BLE advertisements that mimic the usage of various services.
This can cause nearby devices that listen to such advertisements to show unwanted popup dialogs.

Supported services are:

- Apple (new device popups, various action modals)
- [Microsoft Swift Pair](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/bluetooth-swift-pair) (Windows Devices)
- Samsung Easy Setup

End of life services are:
- [Google Fast Pair](https://developers.google.com/nearby/fast-pair/landing-page) (Android devices) -- patched on modern devices
  
You can send BLE advertisements for all services or for selected targets only.

</details>

<details >
<summary>Apple iOS 17 Crash (patched)</summary>
<br>
With some modifications to the advertised BLE package, it is possible to trigger a reboot in various iOS 17 devices.
This causes the targeted iPhone to temporarily freeze for a few minutes before automatically restarting.

This is reported to be partially patched in iOS 17.2, and fully patched in iOS 18.

> Note:
> To achieve optimal results, it is recommended to set the advertising interval to a value between 20 and 100 milliseconds.
>Additionally, locking and unlocking the targeted iPhone can aid in the process.

</details>

<details >
<summary>Lovespouse (Adult Toys)</summary>
<br>
With these BLE advertisements, it is possible to enable and disable various adult toys that support the Lovespouse app.
Additionally, the "Denial of Pleasure" can be executed by selecting the Lovespouse Stops List and setting the repeat mode to Repeat List. More information on this topic can be found <a href="https://mandomat.github.io/2023-11-13-denial-of-pleasure/">here</a>.
</details>

<details >
<summary>Spam Detector</summary>
<br>
The Spam Detector tool allows you to detect nearby spammers, even on the lock screen.
It can identify spam from Flipper Zeros, our app, and various other software and scripts.
Once your device has detected spam, it will send you a notification, indicating whether it was sent by a Flipper Zero or another source.

  > NOTE:
> Location permission and background location access are required for this feature to work.
> These permissions are necessary because Android mandates them for Bluetooth scanning in the background.
> It's important to note that the app will NOT collect your location data.
</details>

## Range

<details >
<summary>Details</summary>
<br>
The range of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can vary between devices.
Some may have a long range, while others may have a short range.

Android's Bluetooth Low Energy API allows apps to set the TX Power level and include it in the advertiser's payload.
However, it doesn't permit direct modification of the byte values actually transmitted in the payload.
This limitation affects the range of the Fast Pair functionality.
Receiving devices calculate the transmitter's proximity based on the actual received signal strength and the transmitted byte in the payload, which contains the TX Power level the transmitter used.

Devices like the Flipper Zero, however, have the capability to modify this byte, significantly extending their range.

## Installation

<details >
<summary>Details</summary>
<br>
You can get installable APK files from the <a href="https://github.com/simondankelmann/Bluetooth-LE-Spam/releases">Github Releases</a>
and from <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/de.simon.dankelmann.bluetoothlespam/">F-Droid</a>.
You can clone the git repo and also build the app yourself.

If you are an end-user looking for a fully functional app, download the Release APK for optimal performance (simply go for this one).
If you are a developer or tester, opt for the Debug APK for testing and debugging purposes.
